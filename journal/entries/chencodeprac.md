## character encoding

nothing to pracitce with this so I decided to just read about it and make a journal.

Binary sytstem uses powers of 2, decimal system uses powers of 10, and hexadecimal system uses 16 didgets which is 0-9 then a-f.

essentially character encoding is a way to represent text characters as numerical codes that computers can process and display accurately. It involves converting text into binary digits, which are the building blocks of digital information. Bits can be 0s or 1s, and their combinations are used to represent complex data.
