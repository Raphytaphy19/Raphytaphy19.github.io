# comments

Syntax: HTML comments start with <!-- and end with -->. Anything between these markers is ignored by the browser.

html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This text will be displayed in the browser.</p>

## Purpose:

Documenting code for yourself or other developers.

Temporarily disabling sections of code without deleting them.

Providing instructions or explanations in complex code blocks.


## Best Practices:

Keep comments clear and concise to avoid cluttering your code.

Avoid using comments to write sensitive information (like passwords).

Use comments to explain the "why" of the code, not just the "what."
