# Journal entry for wordpress project

## What I learned about wordpress

Something I learned while working with wordpress is to always save. I learned this the hard way. The first time I used wordpress for this project I forgot to save and all my work for the project deleted. I quickly redid the page that didn't save but it was irritating that I had to waste time redoing it. One tool I used on wordpress was the AI image creator. With the free version of wordpress you are able to use the AI image creator 20 times with no cost. I used this to get a picture for my food truck and I also made pictures of some examples of my rolls. I used the map feature to show where my food truck will be and I chose locations that seemed funny to me like Ohio, Dubai.
