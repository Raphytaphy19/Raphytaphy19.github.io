## Websites I got inspiration from

I got inspiration from my mom's website which is absolute physical therapy. Her contact page is very easy to read and nice to look at. I got inspiration from the web page design website. I like how the links work well to each page so I put a link in my home page to the about page. Lastly I got inspiration from the canvas website because I like how its formatted and how easy to read the to-do listsbecause of the spacing.

## What I learned about wordpress

Something I learned while working with wordpress is to always save. I learned this the hard way. The first time I used wordpress for this project I forgot to save and all my work for the project deleted. I quickly redid the page that didn't save but it was irritating that I had to waste time redoing it. One tool I used on wordpress was the AI image creator. With the free version of wordpress you are able to use the AI image creator 20 times with no cost. I used this to get a picture for my food truck and I also made pictures of some examples of my rolls. I used the map feature to show where my food truck will be and I chose locations that seemed funny to me like Ohio, Dubai.
