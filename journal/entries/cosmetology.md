# This is my entry for how this project went.

I had a fun time working on this project especially because it was fun to be working with a friend. Even though we were creating different pages we were still on the same team. We didn't run into any trouble with pull requests and merging.

The form was easy to make, we used the same layout for the forms like same type of questions and such. When I had trouble with the forms Charlie was able to help me out because he is good at making forms.
