# Game journal

What genre will your game be? My game will be in the sports genre
What are the objectives? Will there be a score? How do you win or lose? The objective in my game is to use arrow keys to score a goal with a ball. Every time you score a goal you get another point you lose when the ball hits the goalie.

How will the player interact with the game? The player will use the arrow keys to move the ball.

What features will you include in your MVP? I will have a moving ball that can shoot and go on its own trajectory. I will also have a bouncing fast rectangle that will try to stop the ball from entering the goal(going through the rectangle without touching)
