<h2>Commands in vim</h2>
<p>There are many commands in vim that you can use to make things such as tables equations and more. To make a table in vim you start out with the line key (|) and you put three on a line or more depending on how many columns you want on your table. you put one for the atart one for the end and one to put a line through to different groups. The line under the title has to just have dashes for the text.  One important thing to start typing once you are in the vim editor is you have to do shift + i(insert). To end your typing you press esc. If you would like to save and quit then you do :wq(write and quit). If you want to just quit then you do :q.</p>
<h3>Math Equations</h3>
<p>When working with math equations you must know all the different special keys that make an equation look the way it looks. If you do a power symbol you want to put (^) after a number. Some things are the same as seen on the keyboard like an equal sogn will be the same and numbers are the same. Some things are very similar like fractions. For fractions all you have to do is put a number then the divide sign then another number such as 6/2. for all equations in vim for it to show on your website you have to use the $ before and after the equation. To make absolute value bars you have to use the commands lvert and rvert it should look like this(lvert x rvert) but you have to put the dollar signs.</p>
<h4>Headers</h4>
<p>For headers you have to use the # key. When you want to make the biggest header you use one # then start typing if you want to make a smaller one add another # and however many you need.</p> 
<h5>Commiting to github</h5>
<p>Every time we made something on vim we would go through these steps to commit it on to github. once we hit esc to stop typing we write :wq to save and quit. after we go on our terminal and write (git add .) then(git commit -m "random text")then (git push) After this we'd be able to see it on our repository.
