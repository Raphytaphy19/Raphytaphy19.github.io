# What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption

symmetric is when all of the computers that are used to send and recieve know the decryption key. Asymmetric encryption is when only one party knows the decryption key.

# explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process

In this activity we first downloaded the file to decrypt the message then used our key to decrypt it.

# Why is it important that you never share your secret key

It is important because someone would be able to hack and access all of the encrypted messages if they find your secret key.
