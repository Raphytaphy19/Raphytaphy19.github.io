      <p>
        Panqueca is a Portuguese way of making crepes. It's called panqueca because it's a pancake rolled up. Mainly my family makes it with just cheese, but other people put all kinds of things. I chose this because it is a weekly usual at my house and it tastes amazing. One tip is not to put too much cheese. Personally, I like these somewhat burnt so I like to have mine in the oven a bit more than what it says. I recommend the burnt ones more than the non-burnt.
