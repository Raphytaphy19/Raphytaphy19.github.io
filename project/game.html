<h1>This is my game: SOCCER STRIKE!!!</h1>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>You play the game by clicking the arrow keys to move the circle. Once you get to the middle of the screen or further you can click the space bar to shoot the ball. Every time you get the ball through the right wall without the ball touching the rectangle. Try to get as many goals as you can before you hit the rectangle. HAVE FUN!!!!
