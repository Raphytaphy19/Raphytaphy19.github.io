<h1>This is my game: SOCCER STRIKE!!!</h1>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>You play the game by clicking the arrow keys to move the circle. Once you get to the first third of the screen or behind there you can click the space bar to shoot the ball(don't hold unless you want to try a double shot). Every time you get the ball through the right wall without the ball touching the rectangle you get a point. Try to get as many goals as you can before you hit the rectangle. HAVE FUN!!!!
